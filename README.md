# 🧪 KUKA Frontend Assessment

Welcome to the **KUKA Frontend Assessment** repository.  
This assessment is designed to evaluate your frontend development skills across three stages — from basic styling to building a simple application.

## 📝 Overview

The assessment is divided into **three parts**, each increasing in difficulty:

1. **Part 1 – HTML & Styling (Easy)**  
   Test your ability to structure and style a basic page using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**.

2. **Part 2 – Bug Fixing (Intermediate)**  
   Identify and fix issues in existing code. This part focuses on **debugging, reading unfamiliar code**, and applying clean fixes.

3. **Part 3 – Vue Application (Challenging)**  
   Build a **small application** using **Vue**. This part is meant to show your ability to structure components and implement basic interactivity.

Each part has its own folder with a **dedicated `README.md`** explaining the specific tasks to complete.

## 🧰 Getting Started

To get started, **clone this repository** and make sure your environment is ready:

- Node.js **v22** or later installed.
- We recommend using **VS Code** with the following extensions:
  - [Vue Language Features](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
  - [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

These tools will make your development experience much smoother.

### 📦 Installing Dependencies

Each part is self-contained.  
Before starting, navigate into the folder of the part you’re working on (e.g. `part-1`, `part-2`, or `part-3`) and run:

### 🌐 Running the Preview

Once dependencies are installed, you can start a local development server for that part by running:

```
npm run dev
```

This will open a preview in your browser so you can test your work as you go.

## ⏱ Timebox

You should aim to complete the entire assessment within **60–75 minutes**.  
This is not about perfection, but about seeing how you approach and solve problems under time constraints.

## 📚 Guidelines

- You are **encouraged to read official documentation** (Vue, Tailwind, MDN, etc.) as needed.  
- **Do not use AI tools** to solve the tasks directly. We want to understand *your* thought process and skills.
